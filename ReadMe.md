Hi, 
  I am Cir and I am going to become the master in FullStack Development. What is FullStack Development ? Ok, for me it is AngularJS and Node.JS. I agree if you say that I am wrong, but now I am not talking about HTML or CSS and additional and helpful tools. I am about FRONTEND & BACKEND part of web development. There are many other toolkits for web, but I find these two as the most comfortable and effective. Of course, It is only my opinion. 
  I have any bachelor degree. Furthermore, I study publish deal. But I have visited several hackatons and spoken with different developers. I notice that 30 - 35 % of theme are self-taught persons. 
  I am fast in learning everything what interest me. And I like to work together. I want to be helpful as much as possible. I hate tasks which I did often in the past and find easy them. It is so much boring and I will be fast tried. Serious tasks is another deal. Sometimes I like to dream about tech. I am fun, but not may be not at first meeting. I need to adopt. I do it fast. And after I will open myself for everyone. 
  I find some flexible schedule. For example I can work till 24 but from 14 or three. So I am not waiting for high salary. I think about 200-300 bucks. Hope, you are open to the new member.
Best Regards,
Ciril Stas`
